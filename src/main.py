"""
    Snake game
    -----------
    This program is an implementation of the classic Snake game using Python
    and the PyQt library. The game is built using the QGraphicsView and
    QGraphicsScene classes.

    The game follows the standard Snake game rules - the snake grows in size
    when it eats food, and the game ends if the snake collides with itself
    or the wall.

    The game also features a quadtree data structure for the collision
    detection in the game world. This data structure allows for a more
    efficient detection of potential collisions in the game world.
    The snake direction is controlled by the arrow keys on the keyboard
    or the WASD keys.

        A* (A-Star) algorithm implementation to find the shortest path.
        The A* (A-Star) algorithm is an informed search algorithm that is
        used to find the shortest path between two points. It is widely
        used in many fields, including games, robotics, and geographical
        information systems. The algorithm uses a heuristic function to
        estimate the cost of reaching the goal from the current position
        and makes use of this estimate to find the most promising path to
        explore.

        The A* algorithm uses a combination of the g, h, and f values to
        determine the most promising path. The g value represents the
        cost of the path from the start to the current position, and the
        h value represents the estimated cost of the path from the current
        position to the goal. The f value is the sum of the g and h values
        and is used to determine the most promising path to explore next.

        The A* algorithm uses a priority queue to explore the most promising
        path first and gradually explores the other paths based on the f value.

        The implementation of the A* algorithm consists of the following steps:
            1. Create a start node and an end node.
            2. Initialize the open and closed lists.
            3. Add the start node to the open list.
            4. Loop until the end node is found or the open list is empty.
            5. Remove the node with the lowest f value from the open list
               and add it to the closed list.
            6. Generate the child nodes of the current node and calculate
               their f, g, and h values.
            7. Loop through the child nodes and add them to the open list
               if they are not already on the closed list and have a lower
               f value than an existing node in the open list.
            8. Return the path to the end node if found.

        Quadtree data structure to represent the game world.
        The Quadtree is used to store the game objects in the game world. It
        uses a hierarchical tree structure to represent the game world, which
        makes collision detection more efficient.

        The Quadtree recursively divides the game world into four quadrants,
        and can store the game objects in each quadrant based on their
        position in the game world.

        What is a Quadtree?
        -------------------
        A quadtree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has
        exactly four children. Quadtrees are the two-dimensional analog of
        octrees and are most often used to partition a two-dimensional
        space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants or regions. The
        regions may be square or rectangular, or may have arbitrary shapes.

        This data structure is used in many computational geometry algorithms
        and applications, such as the point location problem and image
        processing. The sub regions may be referred to as quads. Each
        node in the tree contains four nodes, which represent the four
        quadrants of the space.

        It should be noted that the term "quadtree" is often used to refer
        to the tree data structure itself, not the quadrants.

        library. The game is built using the QGraphicsView and QGraphicsScene
        classes.

        The game follows the standard Snake game rules, the snake grows in
        size when it eats food, and the game ends if the snake collides with
        itself or the wall. The snake direction is controlled by the arrow
        keys on the keyboard or the WASD keys.

        The SnakeGame class is responsible for managing the game state and
        updating the game world. It uses the Quadtree data structure for the
        collision detection in the game world, which allows for a more
        efficient detection of potential collisions.

        The SnakeGame class initializes the game world and sets up the
        graphical user interface for the game using the QGraphicsView and
        QGraphicsScene classes. The game world is divided into a grid with a

            Check for collisions with the boundaries or the snake's body.
            The checkCollisions method is used to check for collisions with the
            boundaries or the snake's body. It determines if the snake has
            collided with the boundaries of the game world or itself based on
            the new position of the snake's head.

            The boundaries of the game world are the edges of the game window.
            The game world is divided into a grid with a size of
            300x300 pixels, and the boundaries are represented by the edges
            of the grid.

                    boundaries of the game world.
